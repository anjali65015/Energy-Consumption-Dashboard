<img width="1364" height="871" alt="Dashboard" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ac04aee4-9e92-45c6-9e4f-bf5078fc692e" />


This analysis provides a comprehensive overview of renewable energy consumption patterns based on a sample of **2,500 households**. These households collectively consume **1.9 million kWh** monthly and have achieved total cost savings of **$314,900**. The findings reveal distinct trends in energy usage, adoption rates, and financial impact, offering valuable strategic insights.

### **Key Findings**

* **Top Drivers of Energy Consumption:**
    * **Income Level:** Energy consumption is directly correlated with income. **High-income** households are the largest consumers, followed by middle and low-income households.
    * **Primary Energy Sources:** **Wind** and **Solar** are the most dominant renewable energy sources by monthly usage, indicating higher adoption or capacity in these areas.
    * **Geographic Trends:** **North America** and **Europe** lead all continents in monthly energy consumption. On a local level, **rural** households exhibit slightly higher energy usage (1M kWh) compared to their urban counterparts (941K kWh).

* **Strong Adoption Growth:**
    * The data shows a consistent and strong **upward trend** in the number of households adopting renewable energy year over year. This indicates growing market acceptance and a successful expansion of renewable technology.

* **Surprising Insight on Subsidies and Savings:**
    * A critical and counterintuitive finding is that households **without subsidies** have generated significantly **higher cost savings** ($249.5K) than those who received them ($65.4K).

### **Strategic Implications**

The analysis points to several key strategic considerations:

1.  **Re-evaluate Subsidy Programs:** The fact that non-subsidized households see greater savings warrants a deeper investigation. It may suggest that subsidies are targeted at lower-impact installations or that households making larger, unsubsidized investments are reaping greater rewards. The program's structure should be reviewed to ensure it effectively incentivizes maximum cost savings.

2.  **Targeted Marketing & Expansion:** With clear consumption patterns linked to income and geography, marketing and expansion efforts can be more effectively targeted. High-income households in North America and Europe represent a prime market segment.

3.  **Focus on Leading Technologies:** The prominence of Wind and Solar energy suggests these technologies should remain a primary focus for development and promotion to meet existing consumer demand.
